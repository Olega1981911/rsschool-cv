*About Me
===
I have always been attracted to programming, in one way or another I touched different program code. I got acquainted with the development of sites 5 years ago, but then there was no need to study these technologies more carefully, and now I am absolutely ready to study and go this way to the end, and for this I have the necessary skills: quick assimilation of information, passion for new knowledge, an analytical mind, which also helps in solving various problems and the ability to systematize everything.
